# CDK Libraries

A collection of lightweight, focused libraries to enhance your AWS CDK, cdktf, and cdk8s development experience.

## Available Libraries

- **[@cdklib/config](./packages/config/README.md)** - Type-safe, hierarchical configuration management for CDK projects
- **[@cdklib/argo-synth](./packages/argo-synth/README.md)** - ArgoCD-friendly directory structure for CDK8s
- **[@cdklib/aws-policy](./packages/aws-policy/README.md)** - Type-safe AWS policy and prepared policy support

## Philosophy

These libraries follow a set of principles:

- **Simple**: Small, focused APIs that do one thing well
- **Unopinionated**: Provide tools, not constraints
- **Composable**: Work well together and with other libraries
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only depend on what's absolutely necessary
